Performing Simple Linear Regression
Equation of linear regression
y=c+m1x1+m2x2+...+mnxn 
y  is the response
c  is the intercept
m1  is the coefficient for the first feature
mn  is the coefficient for the nth feature
In our case:

y=c+m1Ã—TV 
The  m  values are called the model coefficients or model parameters.
